# Sorting Visualizer

A sorting visualizer built using [Programming Language/Framework] that visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms work. This tool helps users understand the different sorting algorithms through real-time animations, providing an educational way to learn about sorting.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** See algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and others in action.
- **Algorithm Control:** Pause, play, and step through the sorting process.
- **Customizable Data:** Adjust array size and value range for different levels of complexity.
- **Support for Multiple Algorithms:** View how different algorithms perform in real-time.
  
## Supported Sorting Algorithm

- Quick Sort
